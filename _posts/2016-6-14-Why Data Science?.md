title: What is 'Data Science'? Why would a Political Science grad start coding?
---
##Getting a sense of what "Data Science" means
Around a year ago, I was working in Operations at a startup called  [Mighty](https://mighty.com/) (you might still see my face on their website). After working my way through the ranks in sales, I got the chance to work on our operational processes to rehaul, refine and document our standard operating procedure. My primary asset, I realized, in figuring out how to best achieve this goal was company **data**.

I hacked my way using google spreadsheets, periscope.io (and some basic ability to query), to contribute to our 'innovation pipeline': a list of prioritized hypotheses, a process for vetting methodology, and a systematic approach to documenting learnings.

However, our analytical capacity - we had a team of passionate, young, curious folks interested in making their marks - far exceeded the data we had at hand. From our dataset of users that was hopelessly drowned in user-entered noise from an earlier era (think responses to questions like "Who is your attorney?" with everything from benign misspellings to misplaced vitriol "WHY ISN'T THIS WORKING????"), to sales metrics that were literally collected by hand, three things became abundantly clear:

1. We were spending an enormous amount of time and resources collecting data.
2. We could not trust our data definitively, enabling intuition-based strategy to occupy a role too central for a "data" company.
3. A single employee with foresight, skepticism, and a 'Data Science' skill-set could make a dramatic difference.

Thanks to input from some of my teammates (thanks to Darlin and Ish especially for pushing me in the right direction), I began to question an assumption I had long held:

**I am no coder. I don't have the background, I'm not smart enough, and it will probably be soul-crushingly boring.**

I'm going to unpack this piece-by-piece:

*I don't have the background
--* I did not even take a computer science class in college, was deeply unfamiliar with the industry jargon, and did not have a good mental model of how different languages work together, or what exactly a given coder was responsible for.
--* I realized, however, that I had some skills that few coders had that could set me apart: I was familiar (at a high-level) with frequentist and bayesian statistical approaches, I had project management experience, and knew how these skills fit into a start-up.
--* While I avoided computer science in high school and college, I realized that it was not a lack of intellect or aptitude that kept me away from coding, but because of how I defined myself: I had a self-conception as a qualitative writer who leaned on quantitative elements to prove a point, but I did not permit myself to explore the power of programming as an intellectual path. I realized that just because many elements I associated with computer science (such as front-end development or mobile app development) did not fit my interests, Data Science was about telling (or refuting) stories from all available information. Furthermore, it was in-demand and few had these skills; however, there were a wealth of resources and programs for learning the material.

*I'm not smart enough
--* The core idea that I have revised is that computer programmers are in some ways an order of magnitude more intelligent than most (specifically me). In short, I imagined that in the same way that one might never be able to become truely fluent in icelandic without growing up around it, if one did not understand 'programming', catching up would be nearly impossible.
--* Sure, full-stack developers and true 'Data Scientists' (that is, those who develop data analysis techniques or who deal with advanced machine learning, or who are otherwise highly specialized) are an order of magnitude better at what they do than a standard software engineer or data analyst. However, I now see this difference as **fundamentally a function of experience, rather than of 'talent' or 'intelligence'**. There may be some intellectual cut off point, but principally, some people are excellent at these skills because they put in their "10,000 hours."
--* Finally, I realized that the quickly-moving field of Data Science offers an opportunity to new entrants because of the ability to leap-frog older techniques. For example, Pandas (an implementation in Python that makes manipulating, cleaning and graphing easier) did not exist prior to 2008. Open-source languages are evolving constantly, and new software is constantly being implemented (think Segment, Periscope.io, Slack, Tableau, etc..), meaning that **an individual's utility is disproportionately influenced by their work in the last 6-18 months**. This advantages recent entrants to the field, which helps compensate for lack of a computer science background for those like me.

*It will be soul-crushingly boring
--* I recall a close friend of mine who majored in Computer Science spending late nights just about every night in college. At my alma matter (Middlebury College), there were few computer science majors with little interaction with other social-science driven majors. Often, CS majors were less visible socially. **This lead to my biased perception that only introverts and workaholic types can be successful coding** whereas I now believe that these are simply **a reflection of self-selection bias within the field**.
--* I had the impression that 'Computer Science' was a relatively narrow track which taught students to have N'avi style neural bonds with computers, allowing these enlightened individuals to do everything from making websites pretty, to making amazon recommendations, to search algorthems and dynamic interfaces. **I now understand that 'coding' is a highly specialized group of tasks, functions and roles which allow for a similar diversity of specialization as the social science field as a whole.** The logic of building games may not be a strong fit for me, but I do find data fascinating.
--* I also undervalued two feelings in particular: power is exciting, and extracting insights. Data Science gives you a specialization that makes you incredibly powerful within an organization: you are the go-to person for making (some) big decisions.




Data Science is often described as the intersection between statistical concepts, hacking, and domain expertise, but I
