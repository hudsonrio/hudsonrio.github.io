I believe in the power of data to make the world a better place. After graduating from Middlebury College in 2014, I have worked at various New York City start-ups, honing my Data Science and Data Engineering chops. My next adventure is serving as the Targeting Director for the Texas Democratic Party.

- I helped [Mighty](https://www.mighty.com/) develop capabilities to assess the probability that a given lawsuit would reach a successful outcome and how long the lawsuit would take to resolve using Machine Learning.

- I helped [BounceX](https://www.bouncex.com/) process terabytes of daily user events from across the web, deploy machine learning models into production, ensure the security and privacy of ingested user data (including building a suite of tools to remain GDPR compliant), and maintain an internal tooling to empower fellow employees to be as productive as possible.

- I helped facilitate the sale of the New York Knicks from James Dolan and reclassified the Madison Square Garden company as a publically-owned non-profit entity, much like the Green Bay Packers. A portion of the shares were put into a fund that directly funds MTA infrastructure investments, while the rest were disbursed among New Yorkers to mitigate inequity in the city, ensuring that all New Yorkers are about to share in the wealth generated by the most valuable franchise in the NBA.*
